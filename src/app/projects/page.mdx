## Project Theme

As a focus for S1 2024-2025,
we asked students to explore self-tracking and everyday interaction with personal data.

People have long sought to better understand themselves, but continuing technology advances enable new approaches.
Students examined problems people encounter in gathering and gaining value from personal data,
then explored how a combination of design and machine intelligence can help go beyond simple data fetishes to help people in using personal data as part of reaching their goals.
